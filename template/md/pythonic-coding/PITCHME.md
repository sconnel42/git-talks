### Zen of Python

- Beautiful is better than ugly.
- Explicit is better than implicit.
- Simple is better than complex.

### Explicit Coding

#### Bad:
```
def make_complex(*args):
    x, y = args
    return dict(**locals())
```

#### Good:
```
def make_complex(x, y):
    return {'x': x, 'y': y}
```

### A Foolish Consistency is the Hobgoblin of Little Minds

##### Don't break from the style of your code!
